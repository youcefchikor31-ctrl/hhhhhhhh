/**
 * Waterbending, raymarched as a real body of water.
 *
 * Like the fire volume, the mesh is only a camera-facing proxy hull around the
 * flight path (RibbonGeometry's `frame` option): each fragment rebuilds the
 * path's local frame from `aCenter` / `aTangent` and marches a ray from the
 * camera. Fire integrates *through* its medium because a flame is emissive gas;
 * water is not — it has a surface, and everything that makes water read as water
 * happens on it. So the march looks for the first sign change of
 *
 *   field(p) = radius(u) * (1 + swell + chop) - distanceToAxis(p)
 *
 * refines the crossing with four bisections, and shades that point:
 *
 *   normal        gradient of the same field (tetrahedron taps), so every ripple
 *                 in the density field is a real ripple in the lighting
 *   reflection    Schlick fresnel over the scene's HDR probe, plus a tight sun
 *                 glint — the two highlights that read as "wet" at any distance
 *   depth tint    Beer-Lambert over the *analytic* chord through the tube, so
 *                 the thin edges stay turquoise and the belly goes deep blue
 *   translucency  backlit glow through the thin parts of a crest, the thing that
 *                 makes an ocean wave look lit from inside
 *   foam          crest foam where the swell peaks upward, churn foam eroded by
 *                 a ridged octave, spray foam at the silhouette, all broken into
 *                 cells by a voronoi so it reads as bubbles rather than as paint
 *
 * The march is clipped by the opaque depth prepass, so the water is occluded by
 * the ground and the character and softens where it touches them. Refraction
 * itself is the separate distortion buffer's job.
